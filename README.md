# Message Spam Detection Software

### This is a simple webpage application with a python backend. It allows the user to upload a screenshot of a potentially illegitimate text message and provides a percentage readout based on the algorithm. The code uses an OCR to read the text from the image.

The code requires the following python libraries to be installed:
- flask
- werkzeug.utils
- os
- numpy
- pandas
- pyspellchecker
- nltk
- Pillow
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- pytesseract
	
Once these have been installed, the setup.py file must be run once first to ensure nltk downloads the required prerequisites.
You will also be required to install tesseract on your system.

I also have the following YouTube videos which show the code in action!
